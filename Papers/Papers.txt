USING DATA MINING TO PREDICT SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENT PERFORMANCE (P. Cortez)
	Only Portugese students, using student grades, demographic, social and school related features.
	got results that grades where important but also features such as absence and parent's job(s). This study uses DM techniques
VALIDITY OF HIGH-SCHOOL GRADES IN PREDICTING STUDENT SUCCESS BEYOND THE FRESHMAN YEAR: High-School Record vs. Standardized Tests as Indicators of Four-Year College Outcomes (S. Geiser, 2017)
	Not so relevant, only looks at how reliable freshman grades are in predicting the succes of students, compared to their High-school record.
Data Mining: A prediction for performance improvement using classification (B. K. Bhardwaj, 2011)
	Indian student records which are used to generate a 300 record big database. This database in turn is used for a Bayes classification model, used a lot of attributes
	Conclusion: a lot of factors have influence on how a student performs. (Typing error in abstract maybe not so thrustworthy?)
Predicting Student Performance by Using Data Mining Methods for Classification (D. Kabakchieva 2013)
	Predicting student performance on university level, only initial results in the paper and those results are not that great.
